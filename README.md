# Whitebox Controller

Whitebox Controller is an extensible general purpose controller for Kubernetes.

This controller executes processing such as reconciliation or validation of resources required for the operation of the Kubernetes controller by executing specified external commands or sending HTTP requests to a specified URL.

## Motivation

- Allow developers to make controllers without various knowledge of Kubernetes
- Allow developers to implement controllers in their familiar programming languages
- Enable quick validation of new controller ideas
